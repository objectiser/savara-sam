Savara SAM web module
======================

Build the web module:
=======================

Run:
	mvn clean install


Run the web in hosted-mode
==========================
In order to isolate the testing, we've had the AQMonitorServiceMock as a hard-coded mock data,
you can update it in the $web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml, replace the org.savara.sam.web.server.AQMonitorServiceImpl
to the org.savara.sam.web.server.AQMonitorServiceMock in your test. 

And then run mvn gwt:run

*Please remember to replace it back once you've deployed with the server module.



Run the web with SAM Server
===========================
1. Running the Demo according to the README in the SAM project's README
2. Going to the http://localhost:8080/sam-web, log in with any username or password, you will see the charts page, left side is the menu section.
3. Once you've generated a new data, please manually refresh this page to see the chart change, or click each 'refresh' button on its portlet.
