Savara SAM web module
======================

Access the web at: http://localhost:8080/sam-web


Run the web in hosted-mode
==========================
In order to isolate the testing, we've had the AQMonitorServiceMock as a hard-coded mock data,
you can update it in the $web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml, replace the org.savara.sam.web.server.AQMonitorServiceImpl
to the org.savara.sam.web.server.AQMonitorServiceMock in your test. 

And then run mvn gwt:run

*Please remember to replace it back once you've deployed with the server module.
