How do I choose between onReveal() and onReset()?
=================================================

onReset is called whenever a new Presenter is requested,
even if the current Presenter is visible. onReveal is called whenever the Presenter is revealed.


In what order are the Presenter methods called?
===============================================

On First load:

    Constructor
    onBind
    prepareFromRequest
    revealInParent
    onReveal
    onReset
    prepareRequest


On Hiding:

    onHide


On Subsequent Reveals:

    prepareFromRequest
    revealInParent
    onReveal
    onReset
    prepareRequest
